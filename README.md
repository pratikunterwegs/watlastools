This project and the `R` package `watlastools` is no longer actively developed, and has been superseded by the more general `atlastools` package: https://github.com/pratikunterwegs/atlastools.

`watlastools` was an `R` package written by [Pratik Gupte](https://www.rug.nl/staff/p.r.gupte), at the [University of Groningen's Theoretical Biology Group](https://www.rug.nl/research/gelifes/tres/), with functions that process high-resolution shorebird tracking data collected by the [Wadden Sea ATLAS project](https://www.nioz.nl/en/about/cos/coastal-movement-ecology/shorebird-tracking/watlas-tracking-regional-movements).
